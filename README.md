# Photovoltaic Knowledge Informed Neural Network(PKINN)
This repository provides a dataset and example code for research on photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting under fluctuating environmental conditions.  
The data contain synchronized PV power measurements and environmental variables (e.g., irradiance, temperature, and electrical characteristics) collected from multiple silicon-based PV modules under real outdoor operating conditions at a 5-minute resolution. These records capture both gradual variations and abrupt power ramps caused by dynamic weather changes.

The dataset is intended to support research on PV power forecasting, data-driven modeling, ensemble methods, and fluctuation analysis under realistic environmental variability. It enables benchmarking of forecasting models, evaluation of robustness under fluctuating conditions, and development of interpretable prediction frameworks for PV systems.
